Clear-Chrome-Cache
==================

This Google Chrome extension clears the browser's cache, up to the inputted number of minutes.

This project came into being simply because I needed a way to reliably test new material that I was uploading
to my web server. Because of short time between changes, I ran into trouble with my browser storing my JavaScript
in the cache. I could have just used the built-in Chrome tools to clear the cache, or another browser extension,
but frankly, I wanted to make my own.

So here it is, and I will be building upon it as needed.

PLANNED CHANGES:
- Making it look nicer (updating CSS, maybe adding some more to the HTML)
- Add the ability to clear other stored browser elements, like cookies and local storage (HTML5)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- To use the extension, simply load it into the browser (Chrome only), and click the button in the browser toolbar.
You can then input the number of minutes to clear from the browser's cache, and click the "Clear" button.
